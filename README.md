## Summary

For the final assessment of CASA0017, Group 2 made a website called Birds World.
Birds World was developed to help everyday people understand more about the birds that inhabit various areas of London.

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements:

1. VS Code
2. [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
3. [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key)

Once users pull this repo, do the following to run the application:

1. Head over to the [Google Maps API page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key). Follow these steps to create an API key.
2. Using terminal, navigate to the `Website/back-end` directory, and create an `.env` file. Here we will add the GMaps API Key in the following format:
   ```
   GMAP_API_KEY_S=<Insert API Key Here>
   ```
3. Once the .env file has been created, begin the server by running `npm start` from within the `Website/back-end` directory.
4. Install VS Code if you haven't yet, as well as the Live Server Extension.
5. In the bottom right corner, you will see a little button that says `Live Server`, click on that to begin the front-end.
6. Once all that is done, click [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/Website/front-end/) to launch the front page.
