# CASA0017

Birds World

## Abstract
With the rise of eco-tourism and the growing interest in natural environments and wildlife, it is important to provide a convenient information platform for travelers and bird enthusiasts. Our project aims to develop a website that focuses on providing users with maps and profiles of birds to help them better explore the natural environment(London Datastore, 2021). Through this platform, users can easily access the distribution information of a particular bird species and quickly learn about it to fulfill their needs in the process of field exploration and learning.

## Introduction
In a broader research context, ecological conservation and data visualization has become an area of great interest in recent years(NBN Atlas, 2023). Globally, many studies and platforms have been digitized to help people better understand and engage with natural resources. However, most of the existing platforms usually target specific ecological regions or high-level professional users, and lack intuitive and full-featured tools designed for general users. Our project addresses this problem by providing a simple, easy-to-use interactive interface for the average traveler and birder, while enhancing the user experience with map visualization and real-time data interaction techniques.
In addition, the project also focuses on data presentation and integration, by introducing the Google Maps API and REST API, to dynamize static data and help users intuitively access the information they need. Whether professional bird watchers or beginners, this platform can support them and further promote the public's concern and protection of natural ecology. Through this project, we hope to explore the possibility of combining design, technology and ecological protection, and contribute to the sustainable development of society.

## Conclusion
This project has achieved remarkable results in visualizing bird distribution information, optimizing user experience, and improving interactive functions. Hence, it is a practical and intuitive solution for this target group. Moreover, we will rely on the current results to make further improvements on the website by enhancing the number of functionalities, enriching the content and intelligent upgrades. This work not only helps users to learn how to study the nature of birds, but also to participate in nature conservation, putting the society on the path of ecological conservation.
